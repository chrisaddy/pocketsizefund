# Code of Conduct

The **Code of Conduct** for **pocketsizefund** follows three principles:

1. _Creativity_ - explore new ideas and implement them quickly
2. _Collaboration_ - work together to develop the best solutions
3. _Code_ - if it's not in Git, it doesn't exist - Git is truth

Any problems can be reported to the project maintainer via [direct message](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=168005768).
