## About

**Pocket Size Fund** is an open source quantitative proprietary trading firm being built on nights and weekends.

## Goals

> Make money and learn things 💡  

Accountability for these goals is enforced by:  

1. **Publishing performance** on a regular, automated basis

## Development

### Process

Here's our process:

```

We want to rapidly iterate ideas by constantly launching with an MVP mindset for every initiative.  

> Treat every initiative like it has a demo day 🚀
