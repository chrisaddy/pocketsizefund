## About

**pocketsizefund** is an open source hedge fund.  

That means the **_code_**, **_data_**, and **_investments_** are all made by the community. Code contributors are eligible to co-invest and have their contributions managed by the fund. Software engineers, data scientists, and anyone with an interest in finance is welcome to participate.  

The maintainer [@forstmeier](https://github.com/forstmeier) can be reached via [direct message](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=168005768).  

## Infrastructure

This project is intended to be a single instance managing a single fund hosted on the infrastructure currently in [@forstmeier](https://twitter.com/@forstmeier)'s personal AWS account. If you're interested in testing things out in your own account, you'll need to configure the AWS CLI, add a `samconfig.toml` file, setup required third-party dependencies, and use the scripts in the `bin` directory.  

## Contributing

Here are some places to get started:  

1. [Specific larger initiatives](https://github.com/pocketsizefund/pocketsizefund/milestones) we're currently working  
2. [All issues by status](https://github.com/orgs/pocketsizefund/projects/2/views/1) to see ongoing progress  
3. [Forum for questions and discussions](https://github.com/pocketsizefund/pocketsizefund/discussions) for everything else  

We're looking for contributors interested in building things like:  

- sweet **model** training tools and development playgrounds to make the fund even smarter quicker  
- **API** integrations and **data** pipelines so we can generate unique sources of alpha  
- solid **backend** and **infrastructure** to make the fund more robust and scalable  
- **frontend** displays and internal dashboards to make the project more transparent and accessible  

Contributions are welcome and encouraged! üöÄ
