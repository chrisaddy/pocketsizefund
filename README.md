> Recreational quantitative trading 🍊

## About

**pocketsizefund** holds the main resources for the fund platform including data pipelines, model tooling, trading engine, and frontend resources.

## Goals

> Make money and learn things 💡

Accountability for these goals is enforced by:

1. **Publishing performance** on a regular, automated basis
2. **Writing whitepapers** for every significant initiative

## Development

Here are some places to get started: 

1. [Specific larger initiatives](https://github.com/pocketsizefund/pocketsizefund/milestones) we're currently working on  
2. [All issues by status](https://github.com/orgs/pocketsizefund/projects/2/views/1) to see ongoing progress  
3. [Channel for questions and discussions](https://pocketsizefund.slack.com/archives/C04RW9WBXCG) on everything else  

Here's our process:

```
create -> launch
   ^         |
   |         v
learn  <-  measure
```

We want to rapidly iterate ideas by constantly launching with an MVP mindset for every initiative.

> Treat every initiative like it has a demo day 🚀
