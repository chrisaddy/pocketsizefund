## About

**pocketsizefund** is an open source hedge fund.

## Infrastructure

This project is intended to be a single instance managing a single fund hosted on the infrastructure currently in [@forstmeier](https://twitter.com/@forstmeier)'s personal AWS account. If you're interested in testing things out in your own account, you'll need to configure the AWS CLI, add a `samconfig.toml` file, and use the scripts in the `bin` directory.
