## About

**pocketsizefund** holds the main resources for the fund platform including data pipelines, trading engine, and frontend resources.  

## Goals

> Make money and learn things 💡  

Accountability for these goals is enforced by:  

1. **Publishing performance** on a regular, automated basis  
2. **Writing whitepapers** for every significant initiative  

## Development

Here are some places to get started:  

1. [Specific larger initiatives](https://github.com/pocketsizefund/pocketsizefund/milestones) we're currently working on  
2. [All issues by status](https://github.com/orgs/pocketsizefund/projects/2/views/1) to see ongoing progress  
3. [Send me a direct message](https://twitter.com/forstmeier) on everything else  

Here's our process:  

```
create -> launch
   ^         |
   |         v
learn  <-  measure
```

We want to rapidly iterate ideas by constantly launching with an MVP mindset for every initiative.  

> Treat every initiative like it has a demo day 🚀  

If you're interested in running this infrastructure yourself, you'll need an AWS account and IAM credentials with the permissions required to launch the `template.yaml` resources as well as a `samconfig.toml` with appropriate overrides.  

This is a work in progress, a "v0", so expect significant changes going forward.
